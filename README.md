SCUT-FVD: A Finger Vein Spoofing/Presentation Attack Database

## Short Information
SCUT FV Presentation Attack Database (hereinafter: SCUT FVD) is used for scientific research of finger vein recognition. It is collected by BIP Lab, School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology(SCUT). Any one or group is allowed to use this database free of charge.  


The data is split into 3 sub-groups comprising:
1. Training data ("train"), to be used for training your anti-spoof classifier;
2. Development data ("dev"), to be used for threshold estimation;
3. Test data ("test"), with which to report error figures;
Clients that appear in one of the data sets (train, dev or test) do not appear in any other set.


## File Naming Convention
Images are labeled as follow: ID_finger_session_shot_light.bmp,  
where “ID” stands for client's ID, 
“finger” ranges from 1 to 6 standing for the index, middle and ring finger of right and left hand respectively,
“session” stands for session number which can be "0" or "1"   
“shot” stands for the considered shot number ranging from 0 to 5,
and “light” stands for the level of light intensity which can be an integer between 1 and 6.  

Images from the same client are regrouped into a single folder labeled.

NOTE: When processing these images, you only need to consider the first two label, i.e. “ID” and “finger”. 

* Example of the nomenclature for the real images from the client #1:    
  *real/1/1_1_1_0_5.bmp    
  *real/1/1_1_1_1_5.bmp    
  *real/1/1_1_1_2_5.bmp   
  *real/1/1_1_1_3_5.bmp    
  *real/1/1_1_1_4_6.bmp   
  *real/1/1_1_1_5_5.bmp   
* Example of the nomenclature for the spoofing images from the client #1:   
  *spoof/1/1_1_0_0_3.bmp   
  *spoof/1/1_1_0_1_4.bmp   
  *spoof/1/1_1_0_2_3.bmp   
  *spoof/1/1_1_0_3_3.bmp   
  *spoof/1/1_1_0_4_3.bmp   
  *spoof/1/1_1_0_5_3.bmp   

## Request
The SCUT-FVD is publicly available (free of charge) to the research community.  
Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, we cannot provide the database for commercial use.
